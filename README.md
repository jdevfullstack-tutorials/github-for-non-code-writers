# GitHub For Non-Code Writers
GitHub is not only for software development and if you 
are a writer, just like a blogger, even non-tech, 
you can utilize GitHub nnd it really fits your need
as a writer. 

Many will be discouraged to even start because
they think that GitHub is only for software
developers but it's not!

Think of this situation: a source code is purely
text, unless it's graphical coding, but most
of all software development is text-based.
Meaning they are purely text. Now, there are 
several documents that are actually pure text
too. Just to name a few, a poem, a legal document, 
a novel: they are pure text in their natural form.
