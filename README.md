# GitHub For Non-Code Writers
GitHub is not only for software developers and if you 
are a writer, just like a blogger, even non-tech, 
you can utilize GitHub. It really fits your need
as a writer. 

Many will be discouraged to even start because
they think that GitHub is only for software
developers but it's not!

Think of this situation: a source code is purely
text, unless it's graphical coding. But most
of real-world software development is text-based,
graphical coding is just an option for beginners
particularly in the academe.
Now, there are 
several documents that are actually pure text
too. Just to name a few, a poem, a legal document, 
a novel: they are pure text in their natural form.

Now, you'll say that other documents should not
be plain text but rather a rich-text document, but
I'm sure that you know that as a writer, it's 
highly encouraged to write in plain text
so that it can be rendered to different 
formats when published, just like a PDF, 
a web page or an ebook. 

And then we have the full option to simply
use, say, online word processors. 
But you want to avoid specific
platforms, because once
you have utilized one, you
are confined to that. No matter what,
once you open a certain document using
a different platform or 
word processor, there will be 
unexpected changes. But a plaintext document
can be opened on any other machine
that you want to use.

But what if you insist, say, your company
will only use Google Docs, but still, 
as was mentioned, once your content
is published, it's really unpredictable.
So, it's better to write in plaintext format.
GitHub is an excellent tool for plaintext
documents. You have all the luxury of
revision control, a centralized space
for collaboration, a service
to simply turn your content 
as a web page through GitHub Pages,
plus you have the Markdown that renders
your plaintext document 
as an elegant one but preserving the 
plaintext document. Plus, you can easily
get a rendered HTML if that will be
required. And it's really fast
compared to WordPress and others.

Now, GitHub is using Markdown 
for plaintext documents, so that
it can be rendered in an elegant
way (but again, you can still create
a pure text document by indicating
it with filename extension `.txt`), 
that's the reason why the default README
file name extension is `.md`, indicating
it is a Markdown file.
Don't be afraid to learn and use
Markdown. It's simply a collection of very 
simple annotations for
your plaintext format but again you
still preserve the original form.
When we say annotations, you
are telling that there are certain 
styles that should be applied
to some words, phrases or even
the exact format of your document, 
for example,
a certain word will be bold when printed. 
Another example, to organize
a document, you'll be using headings.
You simply add an `#` before the title
so that it will be rendered as the title
or Heading Level 1. Use two `##` for 
second level headings. (In short,
how your plaintext document
will be rendered exactly the way
you want it.)
As you can see, you still preserve the
plaintext format.

For the complete details about Markdown,
(don't worry you can learn this instantly):

And other sites are mentioning that
you need to use Git. No, you don't
need that, not even GitHub Desktop,
if your focus is writing in
plaintext format. The GitHub Web UI 
is enough for your workflow. 

## Steps
So, having said all the encouraging
things, let us start!

### Step 1
Create a GitHub account 
(you just need an email then
follow all instructions):

<https://github.com/join> 

### Step 2
Create a new repository (think
of it just like a regular folder)
but since your focus is writing
content, it will serve as one 
post, I highly encourage for 
every content you write is another
separate repo (but it is just
a matter of personal preference):

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115100729-10fbf280-9f71-11eb-94dc-7e30dd761284.png" /></kbd>

You'll be seeing the above image if 
you are at your dashboard.

To visit
your profile, go to upper right corner
of your screen
then you'll see your avatar, click that

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115100732-15c0a680-9f71-11eb-819d-87434abac467.png" /></kbd>

or directly go to `Repositories`,
so that you can create your new repo.

### Step 3
Initialize your repo:
- think of an elegant name of your repo, this will also
appear as part of the URL 
- make it private first so that it is still your draft 
- fill in the description by powerful words describing
your entire work, this will also be used by GitHub Pages
when you turn your repo into a web page and
will also appear as short description when you share
your repo on social networking sites

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115019416-c4ba9f00-9eeb-11eb-98ad-55295af0057a.png" /></kbd>

- initialize a license or don't include, GitHub rule is that
when there is no license, it's copyright
- don't include `.gitignore`, it's needed when
you use Git, but you don't need this for simply
creating content
- the `README` file is very important, it's
the default display of your repo, so it serves
as your page,
this is also true when you enabled GitHub Pages 

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115019425-c6846280-9eeb-11eb-9f61-76cfbffd1b7d.png" /></kbd>

### Step 4
And when you click the `Create repo`, you're
done with your setup, you will be seeing
your repo and you can start writing
when you click the pencil button.

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115025358-d607a980-9ef3-11eb-8fc1-c0205a9e8157.png" /></kbd>

Then type anything you want 
(just to test), click `Preview changes`

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115030794-110cdb80-9efa-11eb-8295-33e9528ead7e.png" /></kbd>

then at the bottom, once you see the preview
of your changes, click `Commit changes` 

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115030899-2da91380-9efa-11eb-9298-285ebdd7aac3.png" /></kbd>

and you just have your
first commit! That will appear on your GitHub 
profile. Remember, you are editing the file
in pure text form but you are using Markdown
tags.

workflow, check this out:

## A Little Bit Of Housekeeping (not required)
Now, you have the option to remove unnecessary 
things although this one is not required. Click
the gear button as demonstrated below:

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115031509-d22b5580-9efa-11eb-8076-6a82d9e1a2b2.png" /></kbd>

uncheck `Releases`, `Packages` & `Environments`
and add labels so that it can be discovered
by others when they are looking for topics

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115031601-f25b1480-9efa-11eb-9a4c-f37a17f04dc0.png" /></kbd>

then go to the `Settings` of your repo 

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115133873-0eb39a00-a03e-11eb-9d56-b505c1b4f20e.png" /></kbd>

and you can uncheck
`Wikis`, `Projects` and
include `Discussions` tab. 

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115100066-c1b3c300-9f6c-11eb-8c96-1b74aaeb6b39.PNG" /></kbd>

There you can also
make your repo as a template so that
it serves as your template.
Also, make sure you include a social preview
so that it's really presentable when you 
share your repo to other social networking sites.

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115100109-1bb48880-9f6d-11eb-8ed4-3657701e7d48.PNG" /></kbd>

## About GitHub Pages
Right on GitHub, if you want to turn your repo as a web
page for digital distribution and online presence,
make sure first that it is public
(for free accounts, it is not allowed
to enable GitHub Pages of private repos),
if you read
the link I gave you for my personal content
development workflow, I mentioned that.

Now, once the repo is already public
(again, for free accounts),
go to `Settings` again,
and you should
look for the `Pages` tab at the left pane.

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115134025-5dadff00-a03f-11eb-8cb4-b2cc412bd4e0.png" /></kbd>

Then, 

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47092464/115100185-abf2cd80-9f6d-11eb-85b4-1558a7335658.png" /></kbd>

you must select `main` as the source,
so that it is automatic, your README file
will serve as the default page, without
changing anything, then click `Save` first,
then select a theme.

Here is the complete tutorial for GitHub
Pages:

<https://github.com/xdvrx1/github-pages-tutorial>

## Formatted Content Through Markdown
The formatted content through Markdown
can be pasted on Google Docs and the
format will still be correct, in case
you will be needing an equivalent 
Google Docs version.

## Creating PDF
There are two ways to create a PDF
version of your content without installing
anything, first through GitHub Pages, once
you have the web page, right click
it then select `Print` but instead of printing
it, save it as PDF.

The other one is through Google Docs,
once you pasted the rendered content,
click `File` on Google Docs, then 
select `Download` as PDF.
