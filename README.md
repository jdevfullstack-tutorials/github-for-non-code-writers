# GitHub For Non-Code Writers
GitHub is not only for software development and if you 
are a writer, just like a blogger, even non-tech, 
you can utilize GitHub. It really fits your need
as a writer. 

Many will be discouraged to even start because
they think that GitHub is only for software
developers but it's not!

Think of this situation: a source code is purely
text, unless it's graphical coding, but most
of all software development is text-based.
Meaning they are purely text. Now, there are 
several documents that are actually pure text
too. Just to name a few, a poem, a legal document, 
a novel: they are pure text in their natural form.

Now, you'll say that other documents should not
be plaintext but rather a rich-text document, but
I'm sure that you know that as a writer, it's 
highly encouraged to write in plain text
so that it can be rendered to different 
forms when published, just like a PDF, 
a web page or an e-book. 

Another reason why you want to avoid specific
platforms is that, once you do, you
are confined to that, for example, even
though Microsoft Word and Google Docs 
are accessible online, you are quite confined
with these platforms. No matter what,
once you open a certain document in another
platform or word processor, there will be 
unexpected changes. 

But what if you insist, say, your company
will only use Google Docs, but still, 
as was mentioned, once your content
will be published, it's really unpredictable.
So, it's better to write in plaintext format.
GitHub is an excellent tool for plaintext
documents. You all have the luxury of
revision control, a centralized space
for collaboration, a service
to simply turn your content 
as a web page through GitHub,
plus you have the Markdown that renders
your plaintext document 
as an elegant one but preserving the 
plaintext document. Plus you can easily
get a rendered HTML if that will be
required. And it's really fast
compared to WordPress and others.

Don't be afraid learning and using
Markdown. It's simply a collection of very 
simply annotations for
your plaintext format but again you
still preserve the original form.
When you say annotation, you
are telling the publisher that the 
format is exactly the way you
describe it. For example, to organize
a document, you'll be using a heading.
You simple add an `#` before that heading
and it will be formatted as heading.
